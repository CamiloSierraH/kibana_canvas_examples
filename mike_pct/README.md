Download the `snapshots.zip` file, unzip and [follow the documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html) to configure your snapshot directory. Then use `POST /_snapshot/my_backup/mike_pct/_restore` in console to restore the index. This final export was done from an alpha build of 7.0, so you'll need to [become a pioneer](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-pioneer-program-7-0) to test it out.

If you're stumbling upon this some how online, make sure you read the blog post series for the full story.
