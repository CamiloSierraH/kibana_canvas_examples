### Data set

`canvas_office.py` creates documents that contain news articles, the weather and stock information. I run a cron job on a raspberry pi to run this python script regularly every 15 minutes. API keys from Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/api) and News API (https://newsapi.org/) are required and if you plan to use this, some customization may be required for your local news articles and weather.

Drag and drop the Canvas workpad `canvs_office.json` into the Canvas app. This is currently configured to cycle through each page in full screen mode every 5 seconds to show off the workpad, but can be adjusted to something more realistic like 1 minute.
